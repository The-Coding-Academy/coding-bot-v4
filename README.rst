Coding Bot v4
#############
A discord.py bot for The Coding Academy

Feel free to contribute.

Also we need someone to write a better README

****************
How to self-host
****************
Open the command prompt(on Windows)/terminal(Linux, Mac) and run the following thing:
.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/The-Coding-Academy/coding-bot-v4.git; cd coding-bot-v4; . ./setup


It will prompt you to input your discord user id and a token for the bot. After this is finished (assuming no errors popped up, if they did they will tell you how to fix it), you can run

.. code-block:: shell

    python bot.py
    
to start up the bot.
P.S. It can be `python3` for Mac. If the above thing does not work then try `python3` for Mac.

Feel free to open an issue if you get any bugs or something and until then have a good one, alright
